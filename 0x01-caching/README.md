What a caching system is
A caching system is a mechanism that stores copies of frequently accessed or computed data in a temporary storage area, known as a cache. The goal is to accelerate data retrieval and processing by serving subsequent requests from the cache instead of going through the more resource-intensive process of fetching the data from the original source.

What FIFO means
FIFO is a caching algorithm that evicts the oldest entry in the cache first when space is needed for a new entry. It follows the principle of "first come, first served."

What LIFO means
LIFO is a caching algorithm that evicts the most recently added entry in the cache first when space is needed for a new entry. It follows the principle of "last come, first served."

What LRU means
LRU is a caching algorithm that evicts the least recently used entry in the cache first when space is needed for a new entry. It assumes that the least recently used items are less likely to be used again in the near future.

What MRU means
MRU is a caching algorithm that evicts the most recently used entry in the cache first when space is needed for a new entry. It assumes that the most recently used items are more likely to be used again in the near future.

What LFU means
LFU is a caching algorithm that evicts the least frequently used entry in the cache first when space is needed for a new entry. It keeps track of how often each item is accessed and prioritizes eviction based on the least frequent usage.

What the purpose of a caching system
Performance Improvement: Caching systems significantly reduce data retrieval time by serving frequently accessed data from a fast cache.
Resource Optimization: Caching minimizes the load on the original data source, reducing the need for repeated, resource-intensive computations or queries.
Scalability: Caching helps in scaling applications by distributing the load across multiple layers, improving overall system performance.
User Experience: Faster response times lead to a better user experience, especially in applications with real-time requirements.
Cost Savings: Caching reduces the need for expensive resource consumption, such as database queries, resulting in cost savings.

What limits a caching system have
Cache Invalidation: Ensuring that cached data is up-to-date can be challenging. Invalidating or updating cached data when the original data changes is a critical consideration.
Storage Capacity: Limited storage capacity in the cache may result in eviction of items, potentially impacting performance.
Eviction Policies: The choice of eviction policies (FIFO, LIFO, LRU, etc.) affects the efficiency of the caching system and may not be optimal for all use cases.
Consistency: Maintaining consistency between the original data source and the cached data can be complex, especially in distributed systems.
Warm-up Time: Initially populating the cache (warm-up) can introduce latency until the cache is sufficiently populated with frequently accessed data.
Complexity: Implementing and managing caching systems introduces complexity in terms of design, configuration, and maintenance.
Cache Coherency: Ensuring that different cache instances or layers across a distributed system remain coherent can be a challenge.
